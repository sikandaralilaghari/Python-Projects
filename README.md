#Visualize Linear Relationship Using Python

A linear relationship is a statistical term that is nothing but the relationship between two variables. A linear relationship shows how well two variables x and y are related to each other. As a data science professional, you should know how to visualize a linear relationship as it will show the relationship between two numerical features of a dataset. So if you want to learn how to visualize a linear relationship, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through a tutorial on how to visualize a linear relationship using Python.


# Visualize a Linear Relationship using Python

When the value of variable increases or decreases with the increase or decrease in the value of another variable. then it is nothing but a linear relationship. When we visualize a linear relationship, It shows whether the relationship between two features is linear or not. 


You can use any data visualization library in Python to visualize a linear relationship. I prefer to use  plotly as it provides interactive results. But as so many Python Programmers use matplotlib for data visualization, I will show you how to visualize a linear relationship with Python using plotly and matplotlib

# Visualize Linear Relationships using Python

Here's how to visulize linear relationships by using the plotly library in python.

To  visualize a relationship using matplotlib, you have to use seaborn.regplot method. So here's how to plot linear relationships by using the matplotlib library in Python. 


 Update README File for this project.

# Instagram Data Analysis: Releationship between Likes and Impressions 

This project performs an analysis of the relationship between **Likes** and **Impressions** on Instagram using a dataset. The code visualizes the coorelation between these two variables using **plotly** and **Seaborn** for interactive and static plots, respectively.

# Project Overview:
The analysis demonstrates the linear relationship between the number of **Impressions** and the **Likes** on Instagram posts. We use two type of visualization 

**Plotly Scatter plot** with trendline: An interactive plot that shows the relationship and adds a trendline to visualize the correlation.
**Seaborn Regression plot**: A static plot to observe the regression line between the two variables.

## Generate Text Using Python 

Text generation involves generating text using machine learning techniques. The purpose of text generation is to automatically generate text that is indistinguishable from a text written by a human. If you want to learn how to generate text with Python, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through how to use the popular GPT-2 text generation model to generate text using python.

# What is GPT-2 Model?
GPT-2 stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.It is an open source Natural Language Processing model created by OpenAI. It can generate paragraphs of text with the state of the art performance on many language benchmarks. It is also used for machine translation, question anwering, and text summarization. 

To use the GPT-2 model to generate text using python, you need to install the Transformers library in Python. It can be easily installed using the pip command on your command prompt or terminal as mentioned below.

# pip install transformers

I hope you now have have understood what GPT-2 model is and how you can install it in your Python virtual environment. You can read more about this model ['here'](https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/). Now in the section below, I'll explain how you can use this model for generating text using Python.

# Text Generation using Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates text generation using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Specifically, it shows how to use a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-2) to generate text based on a given prompt.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch

Install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install torch transformers


Usage
The following code snippet loads a pre-trained language model and tokenizer from Hugging Face, generates text based on a given prompt, and outputs multiple text variations.

from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained text generation pipeline
model = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

# Generate text
sentence = model(
    "Hi, My name is Sikandar Ali, I am here",
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,
    temperature=0.9,
    max_length=100,
    num_return_sequences=2
)

# Output the generated text
for i in sentence:
    print(i["generated_text"])


Parameters
do_sample: Enables sampling; without it, the model would use greedy decoding.
top_k: Limits sampling to the top k tokens with the highest probabilities.
temperature: Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits.
max_length: Specifies the maximum length of the generated sequence.
num_return_sequences: Specifies the number of generated sequences to return.






## Scrape Table from a Website using Python

Web scrapping is one of the skills that every data science professional should know. Sometimes the data we need is available on a website in the form of a table which cannot be downloaded directly from the website. To use that data for any data science task, we need to collect it from the website using web scraping techniques. So if you want to learn how to scrape a table from Website, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through a tutorial on how to scrape a table from a website using Python.

Scrape Table From Python

There are many Python libraries and modules thaty you can use for web scrapping. To Scrape a table from a website, I will use **urllib** module in python, which is already available in Python standard library. So you don't need to install any external library to scrape data from website. Below is how you can use urllib module to scrape a table from a website using Python Programming language. 

import urllib.request

import pandas as pd

url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites'

with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as i:
    html = i.read()
data = pd.read_html(html)[0]



print(data.head())


In the code above, I am collecting data from a table available on a webpage that contains a table describing the programming languages used in most popular companies. You can see the we have received after web scraping is about the programming languages and databases being used by companies. So this is how you can scrape tables from any website using the Python programming languages.

If you want to save this data in a CSV file, below is how you can save it:
data.to_csv("programming.csv")

After running the above code, you will see the CSV file saved on the same directory where your python file is.
